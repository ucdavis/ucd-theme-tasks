# Upgrading from v3

Version 4 is a complete rewrite away from using Gulp/Webpack for compiling
assets and now uses [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) as the main compiling
engine. This provides better standards and less custom code.

## Update to the latest UCD Theme Tasks version.
```
npm install ucd-theme-tasks@latest
```
